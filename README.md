# Pennalyzer

Pennalyzer is a helper to calculate shared purchases. In a shared flat you often buy things together, but only one person can pay. Usually you have to do annoying math now but this can be avoided using this tool. The name has nothing to do with penalty but Penny - a german discounter.
